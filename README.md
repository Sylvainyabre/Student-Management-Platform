# Student Management System

### By *Sylvain Yabre*

## Project Proposal:
- ### What will the application do?
 
The application will store and manage the list of classes in a school with their respective students. 
Students in the same class take the same set of subjects. 
Each subject will have three exams, two midterm exams worth 25% each and a final 
exam worth 50%. The final grade for a student in a given grade level with be computed using this scheme.
The application will  allow the admin to create a class, register new students, delete students who leave the school 
or the class, or  update the personal information of existing students.  
The application will rank all the students in a class based on  overall GPA and grade in each subject. 
Also, the admin can print the list of all students in a class ranked by GPA/overall average
Finally, the application can  print the transcript of a student.
-------------
- ### Who will use it?
 
The application is intended to be used by a *high school principal* in charge of a particular grade/level
or any school official in charge of managing students and grade reporting.
- --------------
- ### Why is this project of interest to you?
  
This project stems from my middle school experience, our grades and ranking were computed manually, which took a lot 
of time and effort to complete. Building this application is for me a chance to visit my childhood and provide
*a proof of concept solution to that problem*.
